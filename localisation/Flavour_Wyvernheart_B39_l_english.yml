 weapons_of_adventure_desc:0 "Once, Escann made plenty of its own weapons. Many a famed smith came out of the Blademarches, Adenica or one of the other feudal states in the region. Yet now we must cart weapons overland from as far away as Lencenor just to make sure we can survive the night. It is expensive, impractical, and causes far too many logistical challenges when a shipment is late or lost.\n\nLet us light the forges once again, bringing together native Escanni techniques, Vernman preferences, and the eccentric developments made by individual adventurers mastering their own fighting styles. We may never be famous for making any one thing of high quality, but if you want to attach a club to a chain and then stick a gun on it, you know a Wyvernheart smith won’t even blink."

Most were orc, some were not. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] did not want to know the details. They doubly avoided looking at the poorly concealed cages in the corner. One could almost hear whimpering coming from under the covers. Probably filthy orcs.\n\nThe mages’ communications to the court had been adamant: the royal inspection must take place tonight. The cringing woman, apparently risen to a position of prominence amongst the assembled court mages for her invention, beckoned the royal party forward. A tunnel, wide enough to fit an ox-cart through, led deeper into the earth. They descended.\n\nEmerging into a torchlit underground space, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was the first to recognize what the pit below them was: an arena. The giddy mage scampered off to a contraption of gears and levers, and began turning, lifting one of two opposing doors within the pit. Voices gasped and blades unsheathed as a werewolf, in all its ferocity, emerged. The woman kept giggling as she raised the second door. The thing that emerged there was somehow worse.\n\nArms the length of its body raised above its head, tumorous muscles straining as it reached out to the mage who created it. What was it doing? Seeking an embrace?\n\nThe mage pointed at the snarling werewolf, and said one word: “kill.”\n\nThe thing screamed, making a noise that should not exist, and attacked.\n\nThe fight was vicious. By the time the blood loss from being disembowelled felled the thing, it had long since pried the werewolf’s head from its body. “My liege,” said the mage, smiling ear to ear. “My children merely need a name, and I feel none other than their godparent should have the honour.”"

A moment before they could get a straight answer about what the nobles were upset about today, the council doors swung open. Anger at the interruption gave way to curiosity at the scruffy mage’s shocked demeanour. The room of nobles turned to unleash their indignation at one of the mage’s responsible for the rumors they had come to petition the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to investigate, when they were cut off.\n\n“It’s alive!” shouted the mage, throwing up her hands in exultant triumph.\n\nPulling on the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s sleeve like an excited child, the woman led [Root.Monarch.GetName] from the council chambers to the bowels of Gulletpeaks’s imposing mage tower, nobles trailing behind indignantly. There, deep below the city streets, an abbatoir’s bouquet of rancid meat and festering wounds greeted the royal party. A cloth-covered table sat in the middle of the laboratory.\n\nThe… thing that was revealed by the excited mage elicited a wave of shock and fainting spells from the assembled nobles. Humanoid in shape only, the thing bulged with muscles in all the wrong places. Knuckles dragged along the floor as bloodshot eyes tried to escape a tortured face. One could almost see steam emanating from its green-tinged skin.\n\nAll were aghast, except for [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. They had one question on their mind."

Escann was once beset by the Crimson Deluge, a torrential downpour of red rain that inundated the lands. Crops failed, livestock died, and sickly babies were born with liquid-filled lungs. Most of those afflicted innocents perished. Some, however, survived. All of you standing here now, imbued with great ability and grave duty, survived.”\n\nCourt Mage Alyssa surveyed the adepts seated before her, on the cusp of achieving official status and joining the ranks of the Sovereign’s court. Each one held greater innate ability than even she, and she was thrice the age of the oldest floodborn here.\n\nSo be it. Such was the way of the world.\n\n“You floodborn represent the future of magic in Wyvernheart. The future of our works defending the Sovereignty and serving the Sovereign’s interests lie in your hands. By the authority invested in me by the Sovereign of Wyvernheart, I name all of you Court Mages.” The floodborn bared their teeth in wolfish smiles.\n\nAlyssa did not realise something was wrong until it was over. Held in place by magic beyond her strength to contest, one of the former adepts stood to speak.\n\n“We appreciate the former Court Mage’s words, and the training of her and her colleagues. We floodborn have been discussing a change in policy for quite some time. After all, if you are too weak to defend yourself, are you not too weak to defend the Sovereign?”"

No, it is simply a pragmatic choice, whereas the White Walls have a purpose this mountain serves none. Now it will become a monument to the might of the Sovereign and a source of great power.\n\nThe runes begin to glow as a thousand voices rise as one. With a flick of a hand, immense power begins to flow, contained only by a few scant chalk marks on the ground.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] feels nothing as the ritual begins. Everything has been overseen by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. Everything is perfect.\nEven as the sky turns from night to day. Even as weaker mages buckle under the strain. Even as the meteor turns thousands of years of history to dust, [he/she] feels nothing. Until the magical energy settles and the ritual finishes.\n\nIt is said even those in the Dwarovar saw the fire that lit up the sky that night. While the assembled mages were shielded from the blast, those unfortunate to live near the impact but outside the wards were blinded at best or disintegrated at worst.\nAnd in the face of it all, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is silent. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] observes the crash site for how it might best be used while servants carry off wizards drained of every ounce of magic in them. Others pile up the bodies of those who couldn’t handle the strain.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] sends out a tendril of magic to check the site.
